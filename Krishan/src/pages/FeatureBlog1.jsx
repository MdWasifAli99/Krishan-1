  {/* Section 1: Smart Farming Tools */}
  <section className="mb-12">
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Smart Farming Tools</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Smart farming tools leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to revolutionize the way we monitor crops and manage farms. These tools allow farmers to track soil health, weather conditions, and crop growth in real-time. By using data analytics, farmers can make informed decisions that improve efficiency, reduce waste, and increase yields.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Smart Farming Tools" className="w-full mt-4" />
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      AI-powered systems can analyze vast amounts of data collected from sensors and drones to provide actionable insights. For example, sensors can monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity, while AI tools can predict optimal planting times and harvest schedules. This allows farmers to apply resources like water and fertilizers more efficiently, ensuring higher productivity and lower operational costs.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      With the help of these smart tools, farmers are empowered to not only increase crop productivity but also protect the environment by reducing the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and water. As the demand for food grows, smart farming tools provide an essential foundation for a sustainable future.

  {/* Section 2: Sustainable Agriculture Practices */}
  <section className="mb-12">
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Sustainable Agriculture Practices</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Sustainable farming practices are essential for ensuring long-term food security while preserving the environment. These practices focus on maintaining healthy soils, reducing water waste, and promoting biodiversity. Farmers who embrace sustainable agriculture methods can increase productivity while minimizing their ecological footprint.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Sustainable Agriculture" className="w-full mt-4" />
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      One of the key sustainable practices is crop rotation, which helps prevent soil depletion by alternating crops that require different nutrients. This method ensures that the soil remains fertile, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is another sustainable practice that uses biological control methods to manage pests, reducing the need for harmful pesticides.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Additionally, precision agriculture allows farmers to apply the right amount of water, fertilizer, and pesticides at the right time, minimizing waste and reducing environmental impact. These sustainable farming techniques not only increase efficiency but also help mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions and conserving water.
    </p>

  {/* Section 3: Precision Agriculture */}
  <section className="mb-12">
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Precision Agriculture</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Precision agriculture refers to the use of advanced technology to manage and monitor the conditions of crops and soil with great accuracy. This approach helps farmers optimize resource use, reduce waste, and increase yields. By using sensors, drones, and satellite imagery, precision agriculture provides farmers with detailed insights into their fields.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Precision Agriculture" className="w-full mt-4" />
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Through data collection and analysis, precision agriculture helps farmers identify areas of their fields that need attention. For example, sensors can detect variations in soil moisture levels, and drones can provide aerial views of the crops to assess their health. This technology allows farmers to apply water, fertilizers, and pesticides precisely where and when they are needed, reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      As technology continues to evolve, the role of precision agriculture will only grow, enabling farmers to make smarter, data-driven decisions. The ability to monitor crops and soil in real-time will lead to more sustainable farming practices and higher productivity.

  {/* Section 4: Smart Irrigation Systems */}
  <section className="mb-12">
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Smart Irrigation Systems</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Water scarcity is a growing issue worldwide, making it crucial for farmers to adopt smart irrigation systems. These systems use data-driven technology to optimize water usage, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time. This reduces water waste, lowers energy costs, and helps conserve water resources.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Smart Irrigation Systems" className="w-full mt-4" />
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Smart irrigation systems rely on sensors that measure soil moisture levels and weather conditions. Based on this data, the system automatically adjusts the irrigation schedule and water flow, ensuring that crops are watered only when necessary. This technology can help farmers save water, reduce costs, and improve crop health by preventing overwatering or underwatering.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      In regions where water is scarce, smart irrigation is especially valuable. By using this technology, farmers can irrigate their fields more efficiently, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water while minimizing waste.

  {/* Section 5: Drone Surveillance */}
  <section className="mb-12">
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Drone Surveillance</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Drones have become an essential tool for modern farmers, providing an aerial perspective of their fields. Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors allow farmers to monitor crop health, assess field conditions, and even detect pests and diseases early. This technology helps farmers make informed decisions and take timely action to protect their crops.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Drone Surveillance" className="w-full mt-4" />
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      In addition to crop monitoring, drones can also be used for aerial spraying, distributing fertilizers or pesticides efficiently over large areas. By using drones for these tasks, farmers can reduce the need for manual labor and increase the speed and accuracy of their work. This technology not only improves productivity but also minimizes environmental impact by using fewer chemicals.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Drones are also useful for creating high-resolution maps of fields, which can be analyzed to gain insights into soil health, crop growth, and overall field performance. By incorporating drones into their operations, farmers can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase crop yields.
